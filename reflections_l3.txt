Add reflections for lesson number 3

Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When you do not have access to your local files. When working on a joint project, to add to the redame file etc.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Git is unaware which changes are significant.
