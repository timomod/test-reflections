Add reflections for lesson number 3

Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When you do not have access to your local files. When working on a joint project, to add to the redame file etc.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Git is unaware which changes are significant.

Q:Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A: Forks. To clone a repository in another gitHub account directly to your GitHub account. Your forked clone will be independent of the original, but the forking is recorded and referenced to original.

Clone: Either when creating copy locally or to your local device from GitHub. Clone will be independent from original and not referenced.

Branch. Creating branch of your master branch in your repository.Part of the same repository and can be merged back to original master branch.
